# TSX Dependency Status

## Current State
- tsx ^4.20.3 in production dependencies âœ…
- tsx ^4.19.1 in devDependencies (redundant)

## Action Needed
Remove the redundant tsx from devDependencies:
```json
"tsx": "^4.19.1",  // Remove this line
```

## Expected Result
- Only one tsx version in production dependencies
- Render should find tsx during deployment
- Clean dependency resolution

## Next Steps
1. Remove redundant tsx from devDependencies on GitHub
2. Keep tsx ^4.20.3 in production dependencies
3. Test Render deployment with `npx tsx server/index.ts`
4. Deploy vocabulary app successfully
5. Add gamified mastery badges!
