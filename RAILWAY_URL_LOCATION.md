# Railway URL and Access Information

## Current Railway URL
**https://brainy-vocab-vault-production.up.railway.app**

## Current Status
- **502 Bad Gateway** - Application failing to respond
- **Authentication Issues** - REPL_ID and REPLIT_DOMAINS causing startup failures
- **Health Check** - Added `/health` endpoint for diagnostics

## Root Cause Analysis
The application is crashing on Railway because:
1. Missing `REPL_ID` environment variable
2. Authentication setup failing entirely
3. App not starting properly due to configuration errors

## Immediate Solution Needed
1. **Add REPL_ID to Railway environment variables**
2. **Set REPLIT_DOMAINS to Railway domain**
3. **Verify all environment variables are configured**

## Railway Environment Variables Required
- `DATABASE_URL` ✅ (already set)
- `SESSION_SECRET` ✅ (already set)  
- `MERRIAM_WEBSTER_API_KEY` ✅ (already set)
- `REPL_ID` ❌ (missing - this is the critical issue)
- `REPLIT_DOMAINS` ❌ (missing - set to Railway domain)

## Once Fixed
The vocabulary learning platform will be accessible at the Railway URL for all 135 students.
