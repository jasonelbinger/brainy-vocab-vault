# Railway Deployment Guide

Railway is much simpler for full-stack applications like your Brainy Vocab Vault.

## Quick Deploy to Railway

1. **Go to https://railway.app/**
2. **Sign in with GitHub**
3. **Click "New Project"**
4. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. **Choose your `brainy-vocab-vault` repository**

## Environment Variables to Add

After deployment starts, add these in Railway dashboard:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_connection_string
MERRIAM_WEBSTER_API_KEY=your_existing_api_key
SESSION_SECRET=generate_32_character_random_string
```

## Generate Session Secret
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```
Or use any 32-character random string like: `abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678`

## What Railway Does Automatically

- ✅ Detects Node.js application
- ✅ Installs dependencies
- ✅ Builds your application
- ✅ Provides PostgreSQL database (optional)
- ✅ Handles port configuration
- ✅ Provides HTTPS domain
- ✅ Auto-deploys on GitHub changes

## Expected Result

Your application will be available at:
`https://your-app-name.railway.app`

You should see:
- Landing page for unauthenticated users
- Google login functionality
- Vocabulary card creation system
- All features working properly

## Why Railway vs Vercel

**Vercel Issues:**
- Complex serverless configuration
- Full-stack apps need special setup
- Database connection challenges

**Railway Benefits:**
- Simple container deployment
- Automatic full-stack detection
- Better for traditional apps
- Built-in database options

## Backup Options

If Railway doesn't work, try:
1. **Render.com** - Similar to Railway
2. **Fly.io** - Docker-based deployment
3. **Digital Ocean App Platform** - Full-stack friendly

Your application is ready to deploy - Railway should handle it automatically once you connect your GitHub repository.
