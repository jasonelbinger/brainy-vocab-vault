# Git Push Fix - Repository Not Found

## The Issue
You're not in the correct directory. The git commands need to be run from your project folder.

## Solution
Navigate to your project directory first:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/brainy-vocab-vault
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add tsx dependency for production deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Direct GitHub Edit
Since git is having issues, you can edit directly on GitHub:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Edit `package.json` 
3. Add `"tsx": "^4.20.3"` to the dependencies section
4. GitHub will automatically update package-lock.json

## Current Status
- TSX dependency is installed locally âœ…
- Need to get it to GitHub for Render deployment
- Once on GitHub, update Render start command to: `npx tsx server/index.ts`

## Quick Check
Let me test if Render has automatically picked up any changes...
