## Final Steps to Complete Deployment

### 1. Add Environment Variable Values in Railway

In your Railway dashboard, complete these three variables:

**DATABASE_URL**
- Value: `postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_sHd52nuJqNCZQep-polished-hall-acos3eom-pooler.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require`
- (Copy the full connection string you see in the screenshot)

**MERRIAM_WEBSTER_API_KEY**
- Value: Your existing Merriam-Webster API key
- (The one you were using before)

**SESSION_SECRET**
- Value: `abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678`

### 2. Update GitHub Repository

Also update your GitHub repository with the port fix:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Edit `server/index.ts`
3. Change line 65 from `const port = 5000;` to `const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;`
4. Commit the change

### 3. Wait for Automatic Redeploy

Railway will automatically redeploy when you:
- Complete the environment variables
- Update GitHub with the port fix

### 4. Test Your App

After redeployment (2-3 minutes):
- Visit: `https://brainy-vocab-vault-production.up.railway.app`
- You should see your Brainy Vocab Vault landing page
- Test Google sign-in functionality
