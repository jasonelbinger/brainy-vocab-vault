# Deployment Status Check

## Current Status
- tsx ^4.20.3 in production dependencies ✅
- Local development working perfectly ✅
- Render still showing 502 errors

## Likely Issue
Render hasn't rebuilt with the updated dependencies yet. Since tsx was moved to production dependencies, Render needs to:
1. Pull latest changes from GitHub
2. Rebuild with new dependencies
3. Start with tsx available

## Action Needed
In your Render dashboard:
1. Go to your brainy-vocab-vault service
2. Trigger a **Manual Deploy** to rebuild with new dependencies
3. Ensure Start Command is set to: `npx tsx server/index.ts`

## Expected After Rebuild
- API endpoints will respond with JSON
- Main site will load the vocabulary app
- Authentication will work
- Ready for gamified mastery badges

## Local vs Production
- Local: Working perfectly with tsx
- Production: Needs rebuild to pick up tsx dependency

The fix is correct - just needs Render to rebuild!
