# Final Authentication Fix for Railway Deployment

## Changes Made
Updated the authentication code in `server/replitAuth.ts`:
- Changed from hardcoded domain to dynamic hostname detection
- This allows the same code to work on both Replit and Railway
- Authentication will now use the actual hostname (Railway or Replit)

## What This Fixes
- Railway authentication will now work properly
- No more "Invalid Client" errors
- Users can log in from the Railway URL

## Next Steps
1. Commit this change to GitHub
2. Railway will automatically redeploy with the updated authentication
3. Test login functionality on Railway URL

## Expected Result
Your vocabulary learning platform will be fully functional on Railway with working authentication.

## Railway URL
https://brainy-vocab-vault-production.up.railway.app

Students will be able to:
- Access the landing page
- Log in with Google/Replit authentication
- Create and study vocabulary cards
- Use all features of the vocabulary learning system
