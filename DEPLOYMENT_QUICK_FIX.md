# Quick Deployment Fix for Vercel

## Problem
The current deployment shows raw JavaScript code because the build configuration isn't properly set up for Vercel.

## Quick Solution

### Option 1: Upload the vercel.json file to GitHub
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
3. Name: `vercel.json`
4. Content:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "server/index.ts",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/server/index.ts"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Option 2: Alternative Deployment Platform
Try Railway or Render instead of Vercel:

#### Railway:
1. Go to https://railway.app/
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. It will automatically detect and deploy

#### Render:
1. Go to https://render.com/
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set build command: `npm run build`
4. Set start command: `npm start`

## Environment Variables Needed
For any platform:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your Neon database connection string
- `MERRIAM_WEBSTER_API_KEY` - Your existing API key
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Generate: `openssl rand -hex 32`

## Expected Result
Once deployed properly, you should see:
- Landing page for unauthenticated users
- Google login functionality
- Vocabulary card creation system
- All features working as designed

## Current Status
✅ Database: Working (Neon)
✅ API Keys: Configured
✅ Code: Complete and ready
❌ Deployment: Needs configuration fix

The application is 100% ready - it just needs proper deployment configuration.
