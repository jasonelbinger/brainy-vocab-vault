# RENDER UPDATE STEPS - URGENT

## THE ISSUE
Render is NOT automatically updating. You need to manually push changes to GitHub first.

## WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (Required Steps):

### 1. Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
git add server/index.ts server/production-static.ts
git commit -m "Fix deployment: separate production static serving from vite"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Go to Render Dashboard
- Login to render.com
- Find your "brainy-vocab-vault" service
- Click "Manual Deploy" button
- This forces Render to rebuild with the new code

### 3. Wait for Rebuild
- Build takes 3-5 minutes
- You'll see build logs in real-time
- New deployment should work without vite errors

## WHAT I FIXED
- Created production-static.ts (no vite dependency)
- Updated server to use dynamic imports
- Separated development vs production code paths
- Fixed all module resolution issues

## ALTERNATIVE: Use Replit Deploy
If Render keeps failing, just use Replit's deploy button instead - it's much simpler and works immediately.

## THE FIXES ARE READY
All code changes are done. Render just needs to rebuild with the new code.
