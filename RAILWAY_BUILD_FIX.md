# Railway Build Fix - Configuration Updated

## Problem Fixed
The 502 error was caused by Railway trying to run build commands at the wrong time. 

## Changes Made
1. **railway.json**: Removed duplicate build command from startCommand
2. **nixpacks.toml**: Added proper build phases with setup, install, build, and start

## Next Steps
1. Commit these updated files to GitHub
2. Railway will automatically rebuild with correct configuration
3. Your vocabulary app will go live

## Expected Results
- Frontend builds properly during build phase
- Backend starts correctly with built files
- App available at Railway URL
- Google authentication working in production

The configuration is now correct for Railway's build system.
