# Replit Deployment Fix

## Issue Identified
The deployment failed because esbuild was trying to bundle the server with ES modules, but Node.js couldn't resolve the TypeScript imports properly.

## Solution Applied
1. **Created start-production.js** - Custom startup script that uses tsx directly
2. **Simplified build process** - Let tsx handle TypeScript compilation at runtime
3. **Fixed module resolution** - Bypassed complex bundling issues

## How It Works
- Build step: Frontend builds with Vite (working)
- Start step: Uses tsx to run TypeScript server directly (no bundling needed)
- Module resolution: tsx handles all imports automatically

## For Next Deployment
The deployment should now work correctly because:
- tsx is in production dependencies
- Server runs TypeScript directly (no bundling complexity)
- All imports resolve properly through tsx
- Production environment variables work correctly

## Ready for Students
Once deployed, the vocabulary learning platform will support:
- 135 students with individual accounts
- 500+ vocabulary cards per student
- 5-level mastery progression
- Spaced repetition algorithm
- Frayer model templates
- Authentication system
