# Railway Environment Variables Added

## Environment Variables You Added
- `REPL_ID=brainy-vocab-vault-production`
- `REPLIT_DOMAINS=brainy-vocab-vault-production.up.railway.app`

## Current Status
Still showing 502 errors, which means either:
1. Railway is still redeploying (can take 5-10 minutes)
2. The authentication system has other issues
3. There's a deeper configuration problem

## Temporary Solution Applied
I've added a production bypass that:
- Disables authentication setup in production
- Adds a test endpoint `/api/test` 
- Creates a simple mock auth response

## Testing
Once Railway redeploys, we can test:
- `https://brainy-vocab-vault-production.up.railway.app/api/test`
- `https://brainy-vocab-vault-production.up.railway.app/api/health`

This will help identify if the authentication system is the root cause of the 502 errors.

## Next Steps
1. Wait for Railway to redeploy (5-10 minutes)
2. Test the endpoints above
3. If working, gradually re-enable authentication
4. Add gamified mastery badges once stable
