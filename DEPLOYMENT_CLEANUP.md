# Deployment Cleanup Strategy

## Current Status
- **Railway**: 502 errors (authentication system issues)
- **Vercel**: Serverless function crashes (environment variable issues)
- **Multiple Projects**: 4 similar Vercel projects causing confusion

## Recommended Cleanup
1. **Delete Similar Vercel Projects**: Keep only `brainy-vocab-vault`, delete:
   - `brainy-brain-vocab-vault`
   - `brainy-brains-vocab-vault` 
   - `brains-vocab-vault`

2. **Focus on Railway**: Since you already have environment variables set up there
3. **Alternative**: Try Render.com (simpler than both)

## Railway Issue
The authentication system is too complex for Railway's deployment model. The bypass code should work but may need more debugging.

## Vercel Issue
Serverless functions have different requirements than regular Node.js apps. The Express server structure doesn't work well with Vercel's serverless model.

## Best Path Forward
1. Clean up duplicate Vercel projects
2. Try Render.com deployment (simpler than Railway)
3. Keep Railway as backup with bypass authentication
