# Simple Deployment Fix

## Problem
tsx is still in devDependencies, not production dependencies. Render can't find it.

## Solution Options:

### Option 1: Manual GitHub Edit (Recommended)
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Edit package.json
3. Move `"tsx": "^4.20.3"` from devDependencies to dependencies
4. Commit the change

### Option 2: Use Alternative Start Command
Update Render start command to use node directly:
```
node --import tsx/esm server/index.ts
```

### Option 3: Build First Approach
Create a build script in package.json:
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "tsc",
  "start": "node dist/server/index.js"
}
```

## Quickest Fix
Edit package.json on GitHub:
- Cut `"tsx": "^4.20.3"` from devDependencies
- Paste it into dependencies section
- Commit

## Then in Render:
Start Command: `npx tsx server/index.ts`

This should resolve the deployment issue and get your vocabulary app live!
