# Railway Deployment - Ready to Complete

## Status: Almost There!
You're about to commit the railway.json file, which is exactly what Railway needs to properly deploy your application.

## What Happens Next
1. **Click "Commit changes"** - This updates your GitHub repository
2. **Railway Auto-Deploys** - Detects the new configuration file
3. **Proper Build Process** - Railway will now build your frontend correctly
4. **App Goes Live** - Your vocabulary learning platform becomes available

## Don't Forget nixpacks.toml
After committing railway.json, you'll also need to add the nixpacks.toml file:
```toml
[phases.build]
cmds = [
  "npm ci",
  "npm run build"
]

[phases.start]
cmd = "npm start"
```

## Expected Timeline
- Commit railway.json: Immediate
- Railway rebuild: 3-5 minutes
- App available: Once build completes
- Test your app: Visit Railway URL

## Your App Will Show
- Brainy Vocab Vault landing page
- Google sign-in functionality
- Complete vocabulary learning system
- Ready for 135 students

Your application is fully built and ready - just needs this final deployment configuration to go live!
